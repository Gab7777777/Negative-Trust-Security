Negative Trust


1- Everything suspected as a threat vector it is already exploited or has been studied by teams with the necessary resources.

2- Mainstream systems carry manufacturer and developer's alternative access to it's resources.

3- This access can be presented explicitly as control and monitoring or implicitly as errors, and either way intentional in their objectives.

4- Physical and logical flaws although intentional can be unpredictable.

5- Therefore exploits being physical, logicall or hybrid, can be designed but also be the product of investigation and research.

[IT DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF USER BEHAVIOUR ANALYTICS]

Information technology development challenges posterior to the (1) militar, (2) industrial, (3) direct consumption (hard and software), (4) advertising and (5) [social] network analysis; being the collective survey capitalization and user behaviour analysis as core sustainability paradigm:

6- Descentralization as counterpart of integral exploitation of the user.

7- Information, usage, permit request or terms of a service not necessarily explain the reach or exploitability used by the technology involved. Ambiguety as a deceit.

8- Statistics although randomized, still reflect identity, culture, customes, and individuality expressed in a collective context.

9- Name and identity as counterpart of user id. As a mean to humanize the user, declining individual randomization for an identity of his own, and thus reserving in the capacity to decline any use of his way of living to be object of study.

10- Proper statewise documentation as counterpart of randomized, unprivileged corporative digital certification.
