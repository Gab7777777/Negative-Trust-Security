1- Everything suspected as a threat vector it is already exploited or has been studied by teams with the necessary resources.

2- Mainstream systems carry manufacturer and developer's alternative access to it's resources.

3- This access can be presented explicitly as control and monitoring or implicitly as errors, and either way intentional in their objectives.

4- Physicall and logical flaws although intentional can be unpredictable.

5- Therefore exploits being physicall, logicall or hybrid, can be designed but also product of investigation.

[IT DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF USER BEHAVIOUR ANALYTICS]

Information technology development challenges posterior to the (1) militar, (2) industrial, (3) direct consumption (hard and software), (4) advertising and (5) network analysis; being the collective survey capitalization and user behaviour analysis as core sustainability paradigm:

6- Decentralization as counterpart of integral exploitation of the user.

7- Information, usage, permit request or terms of a service not necessarily explain the reach or exploitability used by the technology involved.

8- Statistics although randomized, still reflect identity, culture, customes, and individuality expressed in a collective context.

9- Therefore name and identity as counterpart of user id.

10- Proper statewise documentation as counterpart of randomized, unprivileged corporative digital certification.
